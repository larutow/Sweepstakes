[Where-used]
Dependency injection is used as "constructor injection" on line 15 of MarketingFirm.cs
	
	public MarketingFirm(ISweepstakesManager manager){...}

[Benefits]
Because marketingfirm has a ISweepstakesManager object _manager which is defined by the constructor, we can use shared functionality of the ISweepstakesManager interface (particularly the InsertSweepstakes method) inside the CreateSweepstake method in this class.

Using dependency injection here means that we can instantiate the _manager object as *any* ISweepstakesManager implemented object allowing us as developers to be flexible in logic used for the necessary methods (again in this case InsertSweepstakes is the only method necessary)
